## 🚀 **Backend Behavior**

### **When You Edit:**
1. Frontend navigates to `/assessment/{id}/{pillarId}`
2. Existing responses are loaded from server
3. You make changes
4. Each change auto-saves via `/api/assessment/{id}/save-progress`

### **When You Refresh:**
1. Frontend calls `/api/assessment/{id}/results`
2. Backend:
   - Reads all your latest responses
   - Calculates current/future scores
   - Analyzes gaps
   - Matches pain points to recommendations
   - Extracts keywords from comments
   - **If USE_LIVE_DATA=true:**
     - Calls OpenAI API (or uses cached data)
     - Fetches latest Databricks features
     - Maps features to your pain points
     - Adds "What's New" section
     - Enhances recommendations with latest solutions
3. Frontend displays updated results

## 📊 **Testing the OpenAI Integration**

### **How to Verify OpenAI is Working:**

1. **Check Server Logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f /tmp/openai-server.log
   ```
   
   Look for:
   ```
   🔍 Fetching latest Databricks features from OpenAI...
   ✅ Received response from OpenAI
   ✅ Parsed 6 features from OpenAI response
   ✅ Live data enhancement completed
   ```

2. **Check Results JSON:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:5000/api/assessment/{id}/results" | jq '.whatsNew'
   ```
   
   Should show:
   ```json
   {
     "lastUpdated": "2024-10-13T...",
     "recentCapabilities": [
       {
         "name": "Unity Catalog updates",
         "releaseDate": "2024-03-15",
         ...
       }
     ],
     "relevantToYou": [...]
   }
   ```

3. **Check in Browser:**
   - Open Results page
   - Scroll down
   - Look for **"What's New"** section
   - Should show 5-6 latest Databricks features from 2024

pkill -f "node server/index.js"
node server/index.js
