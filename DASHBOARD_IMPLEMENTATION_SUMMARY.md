Created a comprehensive **Assessment Insights Dashboard** that provides executive-level visibility into all assessments, customers, and key performance indicators. The dashboard matches the exact design specification provided and is fully populated with real data from PostgreSQL.

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. **Frontend Dashboard Component** (`client/src/components/Dashboard.js`)

A full-featured React component with:

#### **6 KPI Cards with Trend Indicators**
1. **Total Assessments** - Count of all assessments with trend
2. **Active Customers** - Unique organizations with trend
3. **Avg Completion Time** - Average hours to complete with trend
4. **Avg Maturity Level** - Average current maturity score with trend
5. **Avg Improvement Potential** - Average gap (future - current) with trend
6. **Feedback (NPS)** - Net Promoter Score with trend

Each card shows:
- Clear label
- Large value display
- Trend indicator (up/down arrow)
- Trend value
- Color-coded (green for positive, red for negative)

#### **Interactive Charts**
1. **Radar Chart** - "Average Maturity by Pillar"
   - 6 axes: Platform, Data, Analytics, ML, GenAI, Ops
   - Two data series: Current (blue) vs Target (green)
   - Interactive tooltips
   - Legend at bottom

2. **Bar + Line Combo Chart** - "Assessment Completions & Avg Time"
   - X-axis: Weekly data (W1-W6)
   - Blue bars: Number of completions
   - Green line: Average hours
   - Dual Y-axes
   - Interactive tooltips
   - Legend at bottom

#### **Customer Portfolio Table**
Comprehensive table showing:
- Customer name (clickable)
- Current maturity score
- Target maturity score
- Completion progress bar (color-coded)
- Key gaps as badges
- Status badge (On Track/At Risk/Delayed)

**Interactive Features:**
- Click any row to view that assessment's results
- Hover effects
- Color-coded progress bars:
  - Green: ≥90% complete
  - Blue: ≥70% complete
  - Orange: ≥50% complete
  - Red: <50% complete

#### **Tabbed Bottom Section**
Three tabs with dynamic content:
1. **Fastest Completion** - Top 2 fastest completed assessments
2. **Biggest Improvement** - Top 2 assessments with highest improvement
3. **Stalled Assessments** - Top 2 assessments not yet completed

Each item shows:
- Customer name
- Completion time
- Owner name
- Clickable to view assessment

#### **Filters & Actions**
- **Time Range Filter**: Last week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months
- **Region Filter**: All regions, North America, EMEA, APAC
- **Customer/AE Filter**: Search by name
- **Advanced Filters Button**: For future expansion
- **Export Button**: Export dashboard data
- **Share Button**: Share dashboard link

### 2. **Backend API Endpoint** (`server/index.js`)

New endpoint: `GET /api/dashboard/stats`

**Calculates Real-Time KPIs:**
- Total assessments count
- Active customers (unique organizations)

- Average maturity level (from current_state responses)
- Average improvement potential (future_state - current_state)
- Pillar-specific maturity data
- Weekly completion trends
- Customer portfolio with real assessment data
- Fastest/Improvement/Stalled assessments

**Data Sources:**
- All data pulled from PostgreSQL via `assessments.values()`
- Real-time calculations on every request
- No caching (always fresh data)
