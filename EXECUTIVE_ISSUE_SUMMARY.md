### Projected User Impact

**If Launched Today:**
```
100 Users Try the Product
├── 40 users on mobile → CANNOT USE (100% bounce)
├── 30 users on desktop → FRUSTRATED (70% abandon)
└── 30 users complete → SATISFIED (but with workarounds)

Result: 70% failure rate
```

**After P0 Fixes:**
```
100 Users Try the Product
├── 40 users on mobile → CAN USE (10% bounce)
├── 30 users on desktop → GOOD EXPERIENCE (20% abandon)
└── 30 users complete → SATISFIED

Result: 15% failure rate (acceptable for beta)
```

**After All Fixes:**
```
100 Users Try the Product
├── 95 users complete successfully
└── 5 users experience minor issues

Result: 5% failure rate (production-ready)
```

**Total Time to Production:** 4 weeks

### Can We Launch Sooner?

**Soft Launch (Internal/Pilot) after 2 weeks:**
- ✅ Possible
- Requires: All P0 issues fixed + 80% of P1 issues
- Risk: Medium (users may encounter bugs)
- Recommendation: Only with close monitoring and support

**Public Launch after 2 weeks:**
- ❌ Not Recommended
- Risk: High (brand damage, user frustration)
- Will result in: High support load, negative feedback

## 💵 COST OF DELAY vs. COST OF FIXING

### Cost of Launching Now (Broken)

**Hard Costs:**
```
Support tickets: $5,000/month (estimated 200 tickets × $25/ticket)
Refunds/Credits: $10,000 (upset customers)
Engineering hotfixes: $15,000 (emergency fixes cost 3x normal)
Total Month 1: $30,000
```

**Soft Costs:**
```
Brand damage: HIGH (hard to quantify)
User churn: HIGH (users won't return)
Sales pipeline impact: MEDIUM (prospects see buggy product)
Team morale: LOW (firefighting instead of building)
```

### Cost of Fixing First

**Hard Costs:**
```
4 weeks of development: $40,000 (3 developers × 4 weeks)
QA testing: $10,000 (1 tester × 4 weeks)
Total: $50,000
```

**Soft Costs:**
```
Revenue delay: $20,000 (4 weeks of potential revenue)
Market opportunity: LOW (competition not significant)
Total: $70,000
```

### ROI Analysis

**Launch Now:** $30K immediate cost + high soft costs + $50K to fix later = **$80K+ total**

**Fix First:** $50K dev cost + $20K delay = **$70K total** + HAPPY USERS

**Recommendation:** Fix first saves $10K+ and protects brand
