# Debugging Blank Page Issue

## What We're Seeing
- ✅ Railway is deployed and serving files
- ✅ HTML loads correctly
- ✅ CSS loads (gradient background is visible)
- ✅ JavaScript file downloads (1.5MB)
- ❌ React app not rendering (blank page with just CSS background)

## Most Likely Cause

The gradient background is from our GlobalNav/HomePage styles, which means CSS is loading. But no content is rendering, which means:

**React is failing to mount due to a JavaScript error**

## How to Diagnose

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
**In your Incognito window:**
1. Press `Cmd + Option + J` (Mac) or `F12` (Windows)
2. Look at the "Console" tab
3. Check for RED error messages

### Step 2: Look for These Specific Errors

**Likely errors to see:**
```
Uncaught Error: Minified React error #...
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
SyntaxError: Unexpected token
Error: useLocation() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component
```

### Step 3: Check Network Tab
1. Click "Network" tab in DevTools
2. Refresh the page
3. Look for any files that failed to load (red status codes)
4. Check if `main.9dcfaf0c.js` loads successfully (should show 200 status)

## Possible Issues

### Issue 1: Router Context Error
**If console shows:** `useLocation() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component`

**Cause:** GlobalNav is being rendered outside the Router context

**Fix needed:** Move GlobalNav inside Router in App.js

### Issue 2: Import Error
**If console shows:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'useLocation')`

**Cause:** React Router not imported correctly

**Fix needed:** Check imports in GlobalNav.js and HomePageNew.js

### Issue 3: Build Mismatch
**If console shows:** No errors but still blank

**Cause:** Railway might be serving a different build than expected

**Fix needed:** Force a clean rebuild on Railway

## Immediate Actions

1. **CHECK CONSOLE NOW** - This will tell us exactly what's wrong
2. Take a screenshot of any errors
3. Share the error message

## Quick Test

Open the console and type:
```javascript
document.getElementById('root').innerHTML
```

If it returns `""` (empty string), React failed to mount.
If it returns HTML content, React is mounting but CSS might be hiding it.
