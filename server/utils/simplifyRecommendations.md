# Recommendation Simplification Plan

## The Problem
Current recommendations show:
- Generic Databricks features (SQL MCP Server, Unified Runs)
- Template-based solutions ("Leverage platform capabilities")
- Not tied to customer's actual situation

## The Solution
Make recommendations **customer-centric** and **actionable**:

### 1. WHAT'S WORKING (The Good)
Show what the customer is doing well:
- Extract from their comments (positive keywords)
- Show what pain points they DON'T have
- Be specific about their strengths

Example:
- ✅ "Version control is in place for code management"
- ✅ "Testing practices are established"
- ✅ "You mentioned: 'We have automated deployments in place'"

### 2. WHAT YOU NEED (The Bad)
Show their actual challenges clearly:
- List the pain points they selected
- Use their exact words where possible
- Prioritize by severity

Example:
- ⚠️ Resource conflicts between environments
- ⚠️ Manual deployment processes
- ⚠️ Poor error handling and recovery

### 3. DATABRICKS RECOMMENDATIONS
Provide SPECIFIC solutions:
- Address each challenge directly
- Give step-by-step actions
- Show Databricks features that help
- Include WHY it matters for THEM

Example:
**Problem:** Resource conflicts between environments

**Solution:** Implement workspace-level isolation

**How:**
1. Create separate workspaces for dev/staging/prod
2. Configure workspace-specific cluster policies
3. Use Unity Catalog for centralized governance
4. Set up budget alerts per workspace

**Why it helps:** Eliminates resource contention you're experiencing, gives each team dedicated resources, prevents prod issues from dev/staging work

**Databricks Features:** Unity Catalog, Workspace Admin, Cluster Policies

## Implementation
1. Use IntelligentRecommendationEngine for context-aware analysis
2. Extract quotes from customer comments
3. Map pain points to specific solutions
4. Show clear before/after state
5. Remove generic feature cards that aren't relevant
