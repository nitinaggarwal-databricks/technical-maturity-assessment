## 🎯 QUICK SMOKE TEST (2 minutes)

**Use this for rapid verification after minor fixes:**

1. [ ] Home page loads
2. [ ] Generate full sample assessment
3. [ ] Overall Results shows data (The Good/The Bad populated)
4. [ ] Executive Summary shows data (not blank)
5. [ ] View one pillar result (loads correctly)
6. [ ] Export PDF (downloads without error)
7. [ ] No console errors anywhere

**If all 7 pass:** Likely safe to deploy  
**If any fail:** Run full regression suite

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If tests fail after a fix:

**1. Clear Browser Cache**
```bash
# Hard refresh
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+F5 (Windows)

# Or use Incognito mode
```

**2. Check Railway Deployment**
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Verify deployment succeeded (green checkmark)
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Wait 3-5 minutes for full deployment

**3. Check Console Errors**
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Look for red errors
- Copy error messages for debugging

**4. Check Network Requests**
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Filter by "XHR" or "Fetch"
- Look for failed requests (red, 400/500 status)
- Check request/response payloads

**5. Check Backend Logs**
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Click on your service
- View logs
- Look for errors or warnings
- Check for "OpenAI initialized" message

**6. Verify Data Structure**
- In browser console, type:
```javascript
// Check results structure
fetch('/api/assessment/ASSESSMENT_ID/results')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Results:', d));

// Check pillar results structure  
fetch('/api/assessment/ASSESSMENT_ID/pillar/platform_governance/results')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Pillar:', d));
```
