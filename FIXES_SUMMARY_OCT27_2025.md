# Fixes Summary - October 27, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ Navigation Text Truncation (FIXED)
**Issue:** Navigation links were getting cut off at medium screen widths  
**Solution:** Added responsive breakpoints and better flex handling

**Changes:**
- Added `flex-wrap` to TopNav
- Added responsive gap sizing (32px ‚Üí 20px ‚Üí 16px ‚Üí 12px)
- Added `white-space: nowrap` to prevent text wrapping
- Added responsive font sizing at 1200px breakpoint
- Reduced padding on CTA button at smaller widths

**Result:** Navigation now displays properly at all screen widths without truncation

### 2. ‚úÖ Advanced Filters Not Working (FIXED)
**Issue:** "Advanced filters" button on Dashboard did nothing when clicked  
**Solution:** Implemented full Advanced Filters panel with expand/collapse

**Changes:**
- Added `showAdvancedFilters` state
- Added onClick handler to toggle panel
- Button text changes: "Advanced filters" ‚Üî "Hide filters"
- Created Advanced Filters panel with 3 filter options:
  1. Maturity Level Range (1-2, 3, 4-5)
  2. Completion Status (Completed, In Progress, Stalled)
  3. Improvement Potential (High, Medium, Low)
- Added "Clear All Filters" button
- Smooth expand/collapse animation with Framer Motion

**Result:** Advanced filters button is now functional with professional UI

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è "Question not found" Error (INVESTIGATING)
**Issue:** Assessment page shows "Question not found" error when navigating to questions  
**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Assessment area not found" OR "Question not found"
- Shows: "Area: üß± Platform, Question index: 0, Total questions: 10"
- URL: `/assessment/[id]/platform_governance`

**Possible Causes:**
1. Data structure mismatch between API response and frontend expectations
2. Questions array not being populated correctly
3. Async timing issue with data loading
4. Framework data not loading before component renders

**Status:** Needs further investigation
- Component expects `areaData.area.questions` array
- API returns `areaData.area.dimensions[].questions`
- May need to flatten questions or adjust data structure

**Next Steps:**
1. Check API response structure for `/api/assessment/category/:categoryId`
2. Verify question flattening logic
3. Add better error handling and loading states
4. Test with actual assessment data
