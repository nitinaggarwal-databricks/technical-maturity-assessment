# üîß HIGHLY TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Audience:** Technical data and AI professionals  
**Enhancement:** Made all recommendations highly technical with specific implementation details  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**  

---

## üéØ **WHAT WAS CHANGED**

### **User Requirement:**
> "The consumer for this assessment is very technical on data and AI tools, technologies. Therefore all the recommendations should be highly technical"

### **Solution:**
Updated the recommendation engine to provide **specific technical implementation details** instead of generic advice, including:

- ‚úÖ Databricks product names and features
- ‚úÖ SQL/Python code patterns
- ‚úÖ Configuration parameters
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step implementation workflows
- ‚úÖ Specific API calls and commands
- ‚úÖ Architecture patterns

---

## üìä **BEFORE VS AFTER**

### **"The Good" - Before (Generic):**
```
‚ùå "Strong governance foundation reduces risk"
‚ùå "Reliable data pipelines enable real-time analytics"
‚ùå "Self-service capabilities reduce bottlenecks"
```

### **"The Good" - After (Highly Technical):**
```
‚úÖ "Unity Catalog used for data governance with access controls of reasonable granularity"
‚úÖ "Delta Live Tables (DLT) pipelines implemented for critical data workflows"
‚úÖ "MLflow used for experiment tracking, model registry, and deployment"
‚úÖ "Self-service analytics platform with Databricks SQL and serverless compute"
```

---

### **"The Bad" - Before (Generic):**
```

‚ùå "Limited monitoring capabilities"
```

### **"The Bad" - After (Highly Technical):**
```
‚úÖ "Manual monitoring, auditing and data integrity checks"

mlflow.register_model(model_uri, "customer_churn_model")

# Feature Store implementation:
from databricks.feature_store import FeatureStoreClient

fs = FeatureStoreClient()

# Create feature table
fs.create_table(
    name="ml.customer_features",
    primary_keys=["customer_id"],
    df=customer_features_df,
    description="Customer demographic and behavior features"
)

# Query for RAG:
results = client.get_index("main.docs.knowledge_base_index").similarity_search(
    query_text="What is Unity Catalog?",
    columns=["content", "metadata"],
    num_results=5
)

# Foundation Model deployment:
import mlflow.deployments

client = mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client("databricks")

# Deploy LLM
endpoint = client.create_endpoint(
    name="llama2-13b-chat",
    config={
        "served_models": [{
            "model_name": "llama-2-13b-chat-hf",

            "workload_size": "Small",
            "scale_to_zero_enabled": True
        }]
    }
)

# RAG application:
def generate_response(question, context_docs):
    prompt = f"""Based on the following context, answer the question.
    
Context: {context_docs}

Question: {question}

Answer:"""
    
    response = client.predict(
        endpoint="llama2-13b-chat",
