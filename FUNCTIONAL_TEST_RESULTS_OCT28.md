## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (P0)

### Issue #1: Configuration Warnings May Impact Production ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Severity:** P0  
**Component:** Server Configuration  
**Observed:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: DATA_DIR not set - using local storage (data will be lost on redeploy!)
‚ö†Ô∏è  OpenAI API key not configured. Content generation will use fallback logic.
‚ö†Ô∏è  DATABASE_URL not found - PostgreSQL not configured
```

**Impact:** CRITICAL
- Data loss risk on server restart/redeploy
- AI-powered features will not work (executive summaries, recommendations)
- Not production-ready without persistent storage

**Reproduction:**
1. Start server
2. Check server logs
3. Warnings appear on every startup

**Expected Behavior:**
- Production environment should have persistent storage configured
- OpenAI integration should be configured if feature is advertised
- Database should be set up for scalability

**Recommendation:**
- **MUST FIX before production deployment**
- Create `.env` file with required variables
- Document setup requirements in README
- Add environment validation on startup

**User Impact:** HIGH - Could lose all customer assessment data
