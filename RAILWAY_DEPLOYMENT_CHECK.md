# Railway Deployment Status Check

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Latest Commit:** 97f63b7 - "chore: Trigger Railway rebuild with navigation fixes"

## Commits Pushed for Railway Deployment

1. **82b7c1f** - fix: Add scroll-to-section functionality when navigating from other pages
2. **7797218** - fix: Use useLocation hook instead of window.location in GlobalNav
3. **97f63b7** - chore: Trigger Railway rebuild with navigation fixes (empty commit to force rebuild)

## Changes Included

### GlobalNav.js
- Added `useLocation` hook from react-router-dom
- Replaced `window.location.pathname` with `location.pathname`
- Fixed React Router navigation state handling

### HomePageNew.js
- Added `useLocation` hook
- Added `useEffect` to handle scroll state from navigation
- Implemented smooth scrolling to sections when navigating from other pages

## Expected Railway Build Process

1. Railway detects new commit (97f63b7)
2. Runs `npm install` in root
3. Runs `cd client && npm install && npm run build` (from railway.json)
4. Starts server with `NODE_ENV=production node server/index.js`
5. Serves built client from `client/build` directory

## Testing Railway Deployment

Once Railway shows "Deployed", test:

1. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+F5 (Windows)
2. Navigate to Dashboard page
3. Click "Explore Framework" in top navigation
4. Should scroll to Assessment Pillars section without errors
5. Check browser console - should have no React/navigation errors
