## 🌐 **DASHBOARD METHOD** (No CLI)

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub
3. **New Project** → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. **Connect GitHub** and select your repo
5. **Environment Variables:**
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`
   - `DATA_DIR` = `/app/data`
   - `PORT` = `5000`

✅ **Backend:** Node.js/Express server  
✅ **Storage:** File-based (65 existing assessments)  
✅ **Health Check:** Automatic monitoring  
✅ **HTTPS:** Enabled by default  
✅ **Auto-restart:** On crashes

---

## ✨ **YOUR FIXES ARE INCLUDED**

All 11 critical fixes are deployed:

✅ PDF export null-safety  
✅ Data path corrections  
✅ Refresh button  
✅ Dashboard URL support

---

## 🔍 **VERIFY DEPLOYMENT**

After deployment, test:

```bash
# Get your Railway URL from dashboard or:
railway status

# Test health check:
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health

# Open in browser:
railway open
```

**Check:**
- ✅ Home page loads
- ✅ Mobile menu works (test on phone)
- ✅ Form validation shows
- ✅ PDF export works
- ✅ Auto-save functions

---

## 💾 **IMPORTANT: PERSISTENT STORAGE**

⚠️ **Current setup uses file storage**

For production, add persistent storage:

### Option 1: Railway Volume (Easiest)
```bash
# In Railway Dashboard:
# 1. Click "+ New" → Volume
# 2. Name: "assessment-data"
# 3. Mount: /app/data
```

### Option 2: PostgreSQL (Best)
```bash
# In Railway Dashboard:
# 1. Click "+ New" → Database → PostgreSQL
# 2. Railway auto-sets DATABASE_URL
# 3. Run: railway run npm run migrate
```

**Without this:** Data may be lost on redeploys!

```bash
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
