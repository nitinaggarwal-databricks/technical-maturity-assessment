# Comprehensive Dynamic Content Testing

## Objective
Verify that ALL content in assessment results is:
1. **Dynamically generated** based on user responses
2. **Different for each assessment** (no static/canned responses)
3. **Pillar-specific** and relevant to gaps
4. **Actionable** with clear next steps
5. **Revenue-generating** for Databricks and partners

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Low Maturity Assessment (Levels 1-2)
- **Target:** Early-stage organization
- **Expected Recommendations:**
  - Focus on foundational Databricks products (Unity Catalog, Delta Lake)
  - Heavy partner engagement (SI partners for implementation)
  - Workshops and assessments
  - POC/Pilot projects
  
### Scenario 2: Medium Maturity Assessment (Levels 3)
- **Target:** Mid-maturity organization
- **Expected Recommendations:**
  - Advanced Databricks features (MLflow, Model Serving)
  - Optimization and scale recommendations
  - Enablement and training
  - Specific use case implementation

### Scenario 3: High Maturity Assessment (Levels 4-5)
- **Target:** Advanced organization
- **Expected Recommendations:**
  - Cutting-edge features (GenAI, AI Gateway, Vector Search)
  - Center of Excellence setup
  - Innovation and experimentation
  - Executive engagement
