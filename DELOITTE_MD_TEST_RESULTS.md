## ℹ️ Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

These are polish items that do not prevent C-suite presentation:

1. **Phase Titles**: Could mention business outcomes in title (but items already have them)
2. **Analytics "What's Working"**: Only 1 item (2+ would be ideal)
3. **GenAI "What's Working"**: Only 1 item (2+ would be ideal)
4. **Operations "What's Working"**: Only 1 item (2+ would be ideal)

**Note**: These are edge cases from randomized data and do not affect overall quality.
