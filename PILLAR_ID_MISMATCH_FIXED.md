# ✅ FIXED: ML & MLOps Now Shows Databricks Recommendations

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Issue:** Machine Learning & MLOps showing generic recommendations instead of specific Databricks products like Analytics & BI  
**Root Cause:** Pillar ID mismatch between `assessmentFramework.js` and `databricksFeatureMapper.js`  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED & READY TO TEST**  

---

## 🔥 **THE PROBLEM:**

**Analytics & BI** showing nice Databricks product recommendations:
```
✅ DATABRICKS RECOMMENDATIONS
📦 Power BI Databricks Connector
   M2M OAuth for secure Power BI integration
   M2M OAuth - August 2025
   📚 Docs →

📦 Explore Table Data with LLM
   Natural language data exploration
   Public Preview - September 2025
   📚 Docs →
```

**Machine Learning & MLOps** showing generic text:
```
❌ RECOMMENDATIONS
• Progress from Level 2 (Developing) to Level 4 (Managed)
• Address identified pain points in ML
• Implement structured improvements across all dimensions
```

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE:**

The **pillar IDs didn't match**:

**In `assessmentFramework.js`:**
```javascript
// Pillar 4: Machine Learning
id: 'machine_learning'  // ✅ Correct ID
```

**In `databricksFeatureMapper.js`:**
```javascript
ml_mlops: {  // ❌ Wrong ID - doesn't match!
  emerging: {
    features: [...]
  }
}
```

Because the IDs didn't match (`machine_learning` vs `ml_mlops`), the system couldn't find Databricks features for the ML pillar!

---

## ✅ **THE FIX:**

Changed the pillar ID in `databricksFeatureMapper.js` from `ml_mlops` to `machine_learning`:

**Before:**
```javascript
ml_mlops: {  // ❌ Wrong
  emerging: {
    features: [...]
  }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
machine_learning: {  // ✅ Correct - matches framework
  emerging: {
    features: [...]
  }
}
```

## 🎊 **EXPECTED RESULTS NOW:**

**Machine Learning & MLOps** will now show:

```

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS:**

### **Files Changed:**

**`server/services/databricksFeatureMapper.js`** (Line 459)

**Change:**
```diff
-      ml_mlops: {
+      machine_learning: {
         emerging: {
           features: [...]
```

**Why:** The pillar ID must match the ID in `assessmentFramework.js` (`machine_learning`) so the system can find the correct Databricks features.

---

## 🎯 **VERIFICATION:**

All pillar IDs now match correctly:

| Pillar | Framework ID | Mapper ID | Status |
|--------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Platform & Governance | `platform_governance` | `platform_governance` | ✅ Match |
| Data Engineering | `data_engineering` | `data_engineering` | ✅ Match |
| Analytics & BI | `analytics_bi` | `analytics_bi` | ✅ Match |
| Machine Learning | `machine_learning` | `machine_learning` | ✅ **FIXED** |
| Generative AI | `generative_ai` | `generative_ai` | ✅ Match |
| Operational Excellence | `operational_excellence` | `operational_excellence` | ✅ Match |

## 🚀 **HOW TO TEST:**

### **Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser**
```bash
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
```

### **Step 2: Click "Try Sample" Button**
```
System will create fully populated assessment
```

### **Step 3: View ML Results**
```
Navigate to the overall results page
Scroll to "Machine Learning & MLOps" section
```

### **Step 4: Verify Format Matches Analytics**
```
✅ Should see "DATABRICKS RECOMMENDATIONS" header
