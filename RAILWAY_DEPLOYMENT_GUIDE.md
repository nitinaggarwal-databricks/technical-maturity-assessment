## 🚀 Railway Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

If your Railway project is connected to GitHub, it should auto-deploy when you push to `main`.

**Check deployment status**:
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Select your project: "Databricks Maturity Assessment"
3. Look for "Deploying..." or "Build" status
4. Watch the build logs for:
   ```
   🗄️ Setting up PostgreSQL database...
   Running migration: 001_databricks_features.sql
   Running migration: 002_seed_databricks_features.sql
   Running migration: 003_comprehensive_features_seed.sql
   Running migration: 004_quick_test_mappings.sql
   Running migration: 005_comprehensive_mappings.sql
   ✅ Database setup complete
   🌐 Starting server on port...
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment via Railway Dashboard

If auto-deploy is not enabled:
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click "Deploy" → "Deploy Latest"
4. Or click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

### Option 3: Install Railway CLI (Future)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to project
cd /Users/nitin.aggarwal/BMAD-METHOD/databricks-maturity-assessment
railway link

# Deploy manually
railway up
```

## 🗄️ Database Configuration

### Required: PostgreSQL Database

Railway needs a PostgreSQL database for the feature system.

**Add PostgreSQL to Railway**:
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically create a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
4. The startup script will automatically run migrations

### Environment Variables Required

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Auto-generated | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `PORT` | Auto-set by Railway | Server port (usually 3000) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Environment mode |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | (Optional) | For enhanced content generation |

**To add environment variables**:
1. Go to Railway project
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Add any missing variables
4. Redeploy

## ✅ Deployment Verification Checklist

### 1. Check Build Logs
Look for these success indicators:
```
✅ npm install completed
✅ cd client && npm install completed
✅ npm run build completed
✅ Client build found
✅ Database setup complete
🌐 Starting server on port...
✅ Server is running
```

### 2. Test Health Endpoint
```bash
# Replace with your Railway URL
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-30T...",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### 3. Test Database Health
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health/features-db

# Expected response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "connected",
    "featureCount": 100+,
    "mappingCount": 68+
  }
}
```

### 4. Test Latest Features Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/features/latest?limit=5

# Should return 5 latest Databricks features from database
```

### 5. Test Frontend
1. Open your Railway URL in a browser
2. Click "Try Sample Assessment"
3. Verify:
   - ✅ No React errors in console
   - ✅ Page loads correctly
   - ✅ Sample assessment creates
   - ✅ Results page displays
   - ✅ Recommendations show
   - ✅ Next Steps display (as strings, not objects)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build Fails

**Check**:
1. Build logs in Railway dashboard
2. Look for npm install errors
3. Verify client build completes

**Fix**:
```bash
# Locally test the build
cd /Users/nitin.aggarwal/BMAD-METHOD/databricks-maturity-assessment
npm install
cd client && npm install && npm run build
```

### Issue: Database Setup Fails

**Symptoms**:
```
⚠️ Database setup failed, continuing anyway...
```

**Check**:
1. DATABASE_URL is set in Railway
2. PostgreSQL database is running
3. Check database logs

**Fix**:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL service is added to Railway
2. Restart the deployment
3. Check environment variables

### Issue: React Errors in Production

**Symptoms**:
- "Objects are not valid as a React child"
- Page doesn't load

**Check**:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab for API responses
3. Verify API is returning correct data types

**This should be FIXED** in commit `d458ca8`:
- ✅ nextSteps now return as strings
- ✅ All data types validated
- ✅ Tests passing locally

### Issue: Scores Show as 0

**This is a KNOWN ISSUE** (separate from React error):
- Scores calculation has a bug
- Does NOT prevent deployment
- Application will load and work
- Recommendations and next steps work correctly
- Charts will show but with 0 values

**Not blocking deployment** - Can be fixed in next iteration

## 📊 Post-Deployment Testing

### Automated Test Script

```bash
# Create a test
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/assessment/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "assessmentName": "Production Test",
    "organizationName": "Test Org",
    "industry": "Technology",
    "contactEmail": "test@example.com"
  }'

# Save the assessmentId from response, then:
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/assessment/{assessmentId}/results
```

## 📞 Support

### Check Deployment Status
1. Railway Dashboard: [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Build Logs: Check for errors in build/deploy logs
3. Application Logs: Runtime logs show server activity

### Verify Locally First
```bash
# Test the exact production build locally
cd /Users/nitin.aggarwal/BMAD-METHOD/databricks-maturity-assessment

# Build
npm install
cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Setup database
node server/scripts/setupDatabase.js

# Start production mode
NODE_ENV=production node server/index.js

# Test at localhost:5001
```
