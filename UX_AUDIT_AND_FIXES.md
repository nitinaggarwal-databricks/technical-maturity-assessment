## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES** (Blocks user workflows)

### **Issue #1: No Edit Button on Results Pages** ‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Problem:**
- Manual assessment: Edit button ONLY visible during question-taking
- Sample assessment: NO edit button ANYWHERE
- Results pages (Overall, Pillar, Executive): NO edit button

**Impact:** 
- Users can't change assessment name after viewing results
- Sample assessments can't be renamed at all
- Inconsistent with user expectations

**Root Cause:** 
`NavigationPanel` (which has Edit button) only imported in `AssessmentQuestion.js`

**Fix Priority:** CRITICAL - Fix immediately
**Solution:**
1. Add Edit button to ALL result pages (AssessmentResults, PillarResults, ExecutiveSummary)
2. Use consistent header across all pages with assessment name + Edit button
3. Ensure sample assessments have full edit capabilities

---

### **Issue #2: Confusing Navigation After Sample Generation** ‚≠ê HIGH
**Problem:**
- Click "Try Sample Assessment" ‚Üí Generates ‚Üí Auto-navigates to /results/:id
- User doesn't know this is a sample
- No breadcrumbs or "Back to Home"
- No indication they can edit/delete this sample

**Fix Priority:** HIGH
**Solution:**
1. Add toast after generation: "Sample assessment created! You can edit, continue, or delete it."
2. Add "Sample Assessment" badge on results pages
3. Add "Back to Home" / "View All Assessments" button
4. Add "Delete This Sample" button for cleanup

### **Issue #4: "Continue Assessment" Button on Completed Assessments** ‚≠ê MEDIUM
**Problem:**
- Full sample assessment (6/6 pillars) still shows "Continue Assessment"

- Should say "Edit Assessment" or "Review Questions"

**Fix Priority:** MEDIUM
**Solution:**
1. Detect 100% completion
2. Change button to "Review/Edit Responses"

## üéØ **USER FLOWS - AS-IS vs TO-BE**

### **Sample Assessment Flow**

**AS-IS (Current - Confusing):**
```
Home ‚Üí Click "Try Sample" ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Results page
       (no edit button, no navigation, user confused)
```

**TO-BE (Fixed):**
```
Home ‚Üí Click "Try Sample" ‚Üí Loading animation ‚Üí Results page
                                                  ‚Üì
                            [Header with: Assessment Name üìùEdit | View: Results/Pillars/Executive]
                            [Badge: üé≤ Sample Assessment]
                            [Actions: Export PDF | Share | Delete Sample | Back to Home]
```

### **Manual Assessment Flow**

**AS-IS (Current - Inconsistent):**
```
Home ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Questions (with NavigationPanel + Edit) ‚Üí Submit
                                                            ‚Üì

```

Home ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Questions ‚Üí Submit ‚Üí Results
                   ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
            [Same header everywhere with Edit button]
            [Consistent navigation: Questions | Results | Executive]
```

## üìù **RECOMMENDED FIXES - DETAILED**

### **Fix #1: Universal Assessment Header Component**

Create `AssessmentHeader.js`:
```javascript
<AssessmentHeader>
  <Breadcrumbs>
    Home > {assessmentName}
  </Breadcrumbs>
  
  <TitleRow>
    <AssessmentName>{name}</AssessmentName>
    <EditButton onClick={openEditModal}>üìù Edit</EditButton>
  </TitleRow>
  
  <NavigationTabs>
    <Tab active={view === 'questions'}>Questions</Tab>
    <Tab active={view === 'results'}>Overall Results</Tab>
    <Tab active={view === 'pillars'}>Pillar Details</Tab>
    <Tab active={view === 'executive'}>Executive Summary</Tab>
  </NavigationTabs>
  
  <QuickActions>
    <IconButton>Export PDF</IconButton>
